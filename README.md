# Multilingual-Translation-with-MBart-50
The project aimed to enable seamless translation from English to Indian languages using the multilingual capabilities of MBart-50. ver 1 million bilingual sentence pairs were preprocessed with language-specific tokens like [en_XX] for English, [te_IN] for Telugu, and [hi_IN] for Hindi, ensuring accurate context-aware translations.
